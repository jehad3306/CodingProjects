This repository houses the code developed for our assignment in the real-time systems subject.
The project involved the utilization of a Mecanum car equipped with four omnidirectional wheels, a Microbit V2, and an ultrasonic sensor for object detection.
The primary function of the code is to enable the car to autonomously redirect itself upon detecting objects in its path. 
This functionality has proven effective in various scenarios. 
Leveraging the capabilities of the four omnidirectional wheels, the car can adeptly maneuver through tight spaces by autonomously adjusting its trajectory.
