------------------------------------------- Bachelor Project ----------------------------------

The Bachelor project aimed to create an algorithm to spot bullet holes on shooting targets using image analysis and collect relevant data.
Because the holes are tiny, we made colored objects and placed them in the holes for detection in phone images.
The algorithm then identified these colored objects in the captured images.

The code files in this folder display the work I did for the project. 
My main task was crafting a efficient and effective algorithm for spotting the colored objects.


Things to consider when looking over the code:

The primary goal was to make a working prototype to test its feasibility. Although the project was more about research than perfection, 
given more time, I would have refined the code. Changes I would have made during the Bachelor project if I had more time include ->


* Replace magic numbers with variables
* Breaking down section of codes into function to make it easier to understand
* Modified repetitive codes into functions
* Implemented error handling
* Minimized the use of nested for loops and utilized vectorized operations provided by libraries such as Numpy
